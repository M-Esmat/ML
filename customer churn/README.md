Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company by applying machine learning techniques. Using historical data, the goal is to classify customers into two categories: those likely to churn (leave the service) and those who will stay. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, ultimately improving customer retention strategies and business performance.

Project Details
Steps Involved:
Data Importing & Exploration:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and explored to understand the distribution of data.
Categorical and numerical features are identified, with unique values for categorical columns examined.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handling missing values by filling in the mean for numerical columns.
One-hot encoding applied to categorical variables to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Feature scaling applied to numerical features to standardize values and improve model performance.
Model Training:

Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost.
The best-performing models are further optimized using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Model Evaluation:

Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
A comprehensive classification report is generated for each model to assess its effectiveness.
Results & Conclusion:

A final comparison of all models' performance allows selection of the best model for predicting customer churn.
The outcome helps businesses understand factors contributing to churn and take action to reduce customer attrition.
Technologies & Libraries Used
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and preprocessing.

Results
Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 82.1%, with a precision of 0.69 and recall of 0.60 for the churned class.
Random Forest: Accuracy = 81.1%, with precision of 0.69 and recall of 0.52 for the churned class.
SVM: Accuracy = 81.4%, with precision of 0.70 and recall of 0.52 for the churned class.
XGBoost: Accuracy = 79.8%, with precision of 0.64 and recall of 0.54 for the churned class.
Random Forest (Tuned with GridSearchCV): Achieved improved results with an accuracy of 81.1%.
Conclusion
The best-performing models were evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and tuning for improving prediction accuracy.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, businesses can use churn predictions to make more informed decisions about customer retention strategies.
