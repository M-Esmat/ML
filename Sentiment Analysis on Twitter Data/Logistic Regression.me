# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Twitter data using a Logistic Regression model. It processes tweets to classify their sentiment as positive or negative. The dataset used is the **Sentiment140 Dataset**, which contains over 1.6 million tweets labeled as either positive or negative.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Sentiment140 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
- **Features:** 
  - `text`: The tweet content.
  - `target`: Sentiment label (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive).

## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Loading:** Import the dataset and structure it for analysis.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Remove non-alphabet characters.
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Perform stemming using NLTK's `PorterStemmer`.
   - Remove stopwords.
3. **Vectorization:** Transform text data into numerical features using `TfidfVectorizer`.
4. **Model Training:** Train a Logistic Regression model.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing sets.

## Results
- **Training Accuracy:** 81%
- **Testing Accuracy:** 78%
